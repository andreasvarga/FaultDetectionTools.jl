The `FaultDetectionTools.jl` package (or shortly`FDITools`) is a collection of Julia functions for the analysis and solution 
of _fault detection and isolation_ (FDI) problems and _model detection_ problems. The functions of this collection rely on 
the [DescriptorSystems](https://github.com/andreasvarga/DescriptorSystems.jl) package [2], whose underlying computational functions are based on the
[`MatrixPencils.jl`](https://github.com/andreasvarga/MatrixPencils.jl) [3] and
[`MatrixEquations.jl`](https://github.com/andreasvarga/MatrixEquations.jl) [4] packages. 

The implemented functions are based on the computational procedures described in Chapters 5, 6 and 7 of the book:

Andreas Varga, "[Solving Fault Diagnosis Problems, Linear Synthesis Techniques](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319515588)", vol. 84 of Studies in Systems, Decision and Control, Springer International Publishing, 2017.

This book describes the mathematical background of solving synthesis problems of fault detection and model detection filters and gives detailed descriptions of the underlying synthesis procedures. 

The targeted functionality parallels the functionality of the MATLAB collection of tools [`FDITOOLS`](https://github.com/andreasvarga/FDITools), whose User's Guide of the version V1.0 is provided in the file [`fditoolsdoc.pdf`](https://github.com/andreasvarga/FDITools/blob/master/fditoolsdoc.pdf).  
Supplementary information on the targeted functionality is also available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08480) in the documentation of the companion MATLAB [`FDITOOLS`](https://github.com/andreasvarga/FDITools) collection.
